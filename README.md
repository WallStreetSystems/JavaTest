Hi,

we would like you to implement a few classes in our example multithreaded application to see your problem solving skills. There is no time limit, you may use google or whatever -- the point is just to provide us with the solution that is in your opinion nice and tidy, peformant most importantly working.

The project is built using Maven in Eclipse so you may reuse it.

We expect that you may need to do a bit of a research on Guice but hey, this is an knowledge that you will find very useful.

The main class is App.java that is an example of an application using logging. It doesn't compile and it's meant only as a 'specification by example'.

Can you please implement the following interfaces and Guice module:

* Log
* LogManager
* LogModule

There is no need to implement LogWriters, you may want to simulate them though.

Please send a solution as a zip file to pavel.halas@wallstreetsystems.com.

Thank you and good luck.

Best Regards,
Pavel Halas
